## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="sherlock.jpg">

Hi, my name is Leonard Francis Vibbi. As a graduate student at MIT Media Lab and a Research Assistant at MIT GOV/LAB, I am passionate about using digital technology to promote innovation in the public and humanitarian sectors. My research interests revolve around the intersection of data engagement and ethics for communities in the global south, particularly looking at how ethical value-driven social, public, and humanitarian goods can be derived from data, including its applications in artificial intelligence.

## Research Interest

My current research focuses on developing a data governance framework that prioritizes community values. This project aims to enable continuous community participation across all levels of data collection and processing. I believe this approach can help us collect data more ethically and sustainably. Alongside my academic work, I have had the opportunity to work across various African countries, collaborating with government agencies and civil society organizations to design and develop civic technology tools. These tools aid in promoting e-government and open data. My passion for public interest technology innovation drives me to continue finding innovative solutions to the world's most pressing problems. The Global South is particularly interesting to me as these problems can be especially acute in this region.
